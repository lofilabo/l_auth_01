ADDING AN ADMIN USER:

=> App\Admin {#663}
$admin->name="admin"

FACEBOOK SDK.

This has a dependency on the facbook sdk.
//Next in the same directory, create a file named "composer.json", 
//then copy this to the file:
{
  "require": {
    "facebook/graph-sdk" : "~5.0",
    "facebook/php-ads-sdk": "2.8.*"
  }
}

//Then install it through composer:
php composer.phar install --no-dev

SAKURA HAS NO COMPOSER INSTALL.
AND /VENDORS IS EXCLUDED BY GITIGNORE
WE HAVE TO PUSH THE /VENDORS DIRECTORY BY FTP.

Include these lines into composer.json, in the REQUIRE block which already exists:
    "facebook/graph-sdk" : "~5.0",
    "facebook/php-ads-sdk": "2.8.*"

then,
composer update
composer install
